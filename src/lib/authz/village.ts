/**
 * THE canonical village mutation guard. Every village-scoped write calls it
 * INSIDE its write transaction, before touching any village data.
 *
 * It reads from the database (never the session or a cache) in two separate
 * statements, on purpose:
 *
 *   1. SELECT status FROM "Village" ... FOR SHARE. Takes a shared row lock, so
 *      a concurrent approval (which UPDATEs this row) waits for this
 *      transaction, and this transaction waits for an approval already in
 *      flight. In a Serializable transaction a village row that changed after
 *      the snapshot makes this statement fail with 40001, and
 *      withSerializableRetry runs the whole mutation again.
 *   2. A separate EXISTS on an APPROVED request. It must be its own statement:
 *      under READ COMMITTED it then gets a fresh snapshot that already sees an
 *      approval committed while statement 1 was waiting. A single combined
 *      statement would keep the stale snapshot.
 *
 * The caller ends the transaction on { ok: false } and answers with a
 * machine-readable error: VILLAGE_INACTIVE (existing behavior) or
 * VILLAGE_READ_ONLY (see VILLAGE_READ_ONLY_CODE).
